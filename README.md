# Vanillafier
Vanillafier provides a quick way to disable most of TShock's protection mechanisms, allowing your users to play without restrictions.

**Use at your own risk. This plugin will allow users to destroy your entire world.**

## What it does:
* Creates a new group 'Vanillafied'
* Moves all users (except superadmins) to the Vanillafied group
* Updates your TShock config file so that new users & guest users will be added to the Vanillafied group

The plugin does not include a way to reverse this process.

## How to use it:
* Install the plugin
* Run the 'vanillafy' command
* Read the output message and confirm that you do actually want to do this (see attached screenshot)
* Complete
